            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of my site is to make the scriptures those in my family are memorizing available to  everyone. We use a fairly effective system to memoize large numbers of scriptures, but this system is greatly aided by having other people test the memorizer. That becomes difficult for those in my family living far away from other family members, especially as our style of testing can be quite unique so it becomes difficult to train someone new in the technique of it. This website will make it easy for me (and my other family members) to be tested over the phone, by making a copy of specifically memorized scriptures available in one localized place. </p>
