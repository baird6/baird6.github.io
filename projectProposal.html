            <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of my site is to make the scriptures those in my family are memorizing available to  everyone. We use a fairly effective system to memoize large numbers of scriptures, but this system is greatly aided by having other people test the memorizer. That becomes difficult for those in my family living far away from other family members, especially as our style of testing can be quite unique so it becomes difficult to train someone new in the technique of it. This website will make it easy for me (and my other family members) to be tested over the phone, by making a copy of specifically memorized scriptures available in one localized place. </p>
            <h3>JSON</h3>
            <p>I'll use a json file for all five pages. I'll pull quotes from json and the main content. </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <h3>Page 1</h3>
            <p>This page will hold a few quotes about the power of the scriptures and the benefit of memorizing them. In addition, this page will lay forth the system for memorizing 365 scriptures in a year. More importantly it will have links to the pages for each individual memorizer.</p>
            <h3>Page 2 - Dad</h3>
            <p>This page will hold about 15 of Dad's scriptures. Each scripture will also have a reference and possibly a time period (19 year of the reign of the judges). Some scriptures might also have a link to another scripture (like, compare Isaih 53). In addition to information about the scripture and the scripture, there will also be a date for when the scripture was originally memorized. Obviously, there will also be a nav bar connecting to all the other pages. Additionally, there will be a floating nav bar connecting to each reference and back to the top of the document, for easy navigation. </p>
            <h3>Page 3 - Caleb</h3>
