            <h2>I</h2>
            <p> Half a league, half a league,<br>
                Half a league onward, <br>
                All in the valley of Death <br>
                Rode the six hundred. <br>
                <q>Forward, the Light Brigade! <br>
                    Charge for the guns!</q> he said: <br>
                Into the valley of Death <br>
                Rode the six hundred.</p>
            <h2>II</h2>
            <p><q>Forward, the Light Brigade!</q><br>
                Was there a man dismay'd? <br>
                Not tho' the soldier knew <br>
                Someone had blunder'd: <br>
                Theirs not to make reply, <br>
                Theirs not to reason why, <br>
                Theirs but to do and die: <br>
                Into the valley of Death <br>
                Rode the six hundred. <br>
            </p>
            <h2>III</h2>
            <p>Cannon to right of them, <br>
                Cannon to left of them, <br>
                Cannon in front of them <br>
                Volley'd and thunder'd; <br>
                Storm'd at with shot and shell, <br>
                Boldly they rode and well, <br>
                Into the jaws of Death, <br>
                Into the mouth of Hell <br>
                Rode the six hundred.<br></p>
            <h2>IV</h2>
            <p> Flash'd all their sabres bare, <br>
                Flash'd as they turn'd in air, <br>
                Sabring the gunners there, <br>
                Charging an army, while <br>
                All the world wonder'd: <br>
                Plunged in the battery-smoke <br>
                Right thro' the line they broke; <br>
                Cossack and Russian <br>
                Reel'd from the sabre stroke <br>
                Shatter'd and sunder'd. <br>
                Then they rode back, but not <br>
                Not the six hundred. <br> </p>
            <h2>V</h2>
            <p>Cannon to right of them, <br>
                Cannon to left of them, <br>
                Cannon behind them <br>
                Volley'd and thunder'd; <br>
                Storm'd at with shot and shell, <br>
                While horse and hero fell, <br>
                They that had fought so well <br>
                Came thro' the jaws of Death <br>
                Back from the mouth of Hell, <br>
                All that was left of them, <br>
                Left of six hundred. <br>
            </p>
            <h2>VI</h2>
            <p>When can their glory fade? <br>
                O the wild charge they made! <br>
                All the world wondered.<br>
                Honor the charge they made, <br>
                Honor the Light Brigade, <br>
                Noble six hundred. <br>
            </p>
