            <p>
                There were thirty million English who talked of England's might,<br>
                There were twenty broken troopers who lacked a bed for the night. <br>
                They had neither food nor money, they had neither service nor trade;<br>
                They were only shiftless soldiers, the last of the Light Brigade.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                They felt that life was fleeting; they knew not that art was long,<br>
                That though they were dying of famine, they lived in deathless song.<br>
                They asked for a little money to keep the wolf from the door;<br>
                And the thirty million English sent twenty pounds and four!<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                They laid their heads together that were scarred and lined and grey;<br>
                Keen were the Russian sabres, but want was keener than they;<br>
                And an old Troop-Sergeant muttered, "Let us go to the man who writes <br>
                The things on Balaclava the kiddies at school recites."<br>
            </p>
            <img src="HomelessWrappedInNewspaper.jpg" alt="Soldiers put heads together" height="300">
            <p>
                They went without bands or colours, a regiment ten-file strong,<br>
                To look for the Master-singer who had crowned them all in his song;<br>
                And, waiting his servant's order, by the garden gate they stayed,<br>
                A desolate little cluster, the last of the Light Brigade.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                They strove to stand to attention, to straighen the toil-bowed back;<br>
                They drilled on an empty stomach, the loose-knit files fell slack;<br>
                With stooping of weary shoulders, in garments tattered and frayed,<br>
                They shambled into his presence, the last of the Light Brigade. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The old Troop-Sergeant was spokesman, and "Beggin' your pardon," he said,<br>
                "You wrote o' the Light Brigade, sir. Here's all that isn't dead.<br>
                An' it's all come true what you wrote, sir, regardin' the mouth of hell;<br>
                For we're all of us nigh to the workhouse, an' we thought we'd call an' tell.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                "No, thank you, we don't want food, sir; but couldn't you take an' write <br>
                A sort of 'to be continued' and 'see next page' o' the fight?<br>
                We think that someone has blundered, an' couldn't you tell 'em how?<br>
                You wrote we were heroes once, sir. Please, write we are starving now."<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The poor little army departed, limping and lean and forlorn.<br>
                And the heart of the Master-singer grew hot with "the scorn of scorn." <br>
                And he wrote for them wonderful verses that swept the land like flame,<br>
                Till the fatted souls of the English were scourged with the thing called Shame.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                They sent a cheque to the felon that sprang from an Irish bog;<br>
                They healed the spavined cab-horse; they housed the homeless dog;<br>
                And they sent (you may call me a liar), when felon and beast were paid,<br>
                A cheque, for enough to live on, to the last of the Light Brigade.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                O thirty million English that babble of England's might,<br>
                Behold there are twenty heroes who lack their food to-night;<br>
                Our children's children are lisping to "honour the charge they made - "<br>
                And we leave to the streets and the workhouse the charge of the Light Brigade! <br>
